# Yellow Pages Tweetbot for ConUHacks 2017

This is a twitter bot written in Python3 that responds with recommended local businesses a user might want to checkout based on the content of their tweet if they include the hash tag #askYP.

# How to use

1. Install Python3
2. Install the NLTK module for python3: http://www.nltk.org/ (The NLTK module is used to get the key nouns from a users tweet)
